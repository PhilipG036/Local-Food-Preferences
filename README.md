Methodology
1. Input data :-
The input location is taken from the user. The input is given by the user by selecting the location wanted from the drop down . The user can choose the location from the dropdown as per the choice.AAS the application gets initaiated the application insists the user to provide the input data. The user can provide the input in the user interface that will be appeared as soon as the application gets initiated. It will be taken as the input to match with the data that has been used as the source for the analysis.
2. Data Analysis :-
The input which has been given by the user will be taken and used for further analysis. The input location will be searched in the data that has been used as the source for the application. As the location gets matched with the data present in the source file the it is sent to the frontend for displaying to the user. The location/input is matched in such a way that it gets scanned with the entire source file untill it gets the correct matched location in the source file i.e the location itself should be present in the source file in order to get matched and for displaying to the user.

Conclusion:
We can conclude that the local food items application is useful to the user in the required manner. The results intended to obtain are obtained by the application. The application is implemented with python backend framework like flask and python libraries like numpy, pandas etc. The local food preferences keenly supplies the information regarding the local food items in which the location is given by the user as a input. The apllication can be further used in the nutrition analysis as per the requirements of the organizers.

Future scope:
